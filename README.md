4×4 Matrix Keypad Module Hardware Overview These Keypad modules are made of thin,
flexible membrane material. The 4 x4 keypad module consists of 16 keys, these Keys are
organized in a matrix of rows and columns. All these switches are connected to each other
with a conductive trace. Normally there is no connection between rows and columns. When 
we will press a key, then a row and a column make contact.

## Procedure :

## LCD 16X2
